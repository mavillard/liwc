    "In order to answer the question *\"Do the media convey predominantly positive or negative messages about entrepreneurship, and if so, does that matter?\"*, we analyzed the sentiment associated to business-related textual excerpts. These excerpts were sentences extracted from the New York Times for the period January 1999 to December 2014 that contained certain keywords related to the business world. Upon completing the analysis, our conclusion is *\"Yes, the media convey positive messages.\"* \n",

    "1. Classifier design\n",

    "3. Sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, a nearest centroid classifier was trained with the dataset consisted of 8,996 sentences that our 190 participants had previously assessed. Secondly, we coded a Python script to search for articles, via the NYT API, that contained the business-related keywords. Finally, the classifier assigned a (positive or negative) value to the sentences extracted from the articles.\n",
