    "In order to power an artificial intelligence program able to analyze vast amounts of text and assess the related sentiment, we needed to have human subjects report their reaction to business-related textual excerpts. We had 190 participants who signed up for one of the available time slots to complete the survey at Ivey's Behavioural Lab. Participants went to the Lab at the scheduled time and for 60 minutes (with an 8-minute break in between) they assessed as many sentences as they could using the PyBossa crowdsourcing platform.\n",

    "The main goal of this project was to create a reliable sentiment classifier for the business domain. Our working hypothesis was that due to the complexity and rhetoric of the business world, current industry solutions for sentiment analysis would perform poorly. We used the renowned LIWC as the de facto standard to evaluate these texts and compare its results with our pool of participants.\n",

    "Upon completing the analysis, every sentence got a value for posemo, between 0 and 100 (%), and another value for negemo, also between 0 and 100 (%). This two metrics were used to calculate the final score per sentence by considering two options:\n",
    "- Option 1) Subtraction:\n",
    "    - score = posemo - negemo\n",
    "- Option 2) Maximum:\n",
    "    - if posemo > negemo, then score = posemo\n",
