    "In this occasion, in order to answer the question *\"Do the media convey predominantly positive or negative messages about entrepreneurship, and if so, does that matter?\"*, we analyzed the sentiment associated to business-related sentences extracted from the Financial Times for the period January 2003 to December 2014 that contained the keywords related to the business world previously used in the experiment with the New York Times. Upon completing the analysis, our conclusion is the same - *\"Yes, the media convey positive messages.\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the project was performed in three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fulltext access\n",
    "2. Sentence extraction\n",
    "3. Sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, FT provided us with the fulltext articles from 2003 to 2014 in XML. Secondly, we coded two scripts in Python - one to unify the format of all the articles across the different XML files and another one that searched for the articles that contained the business-related keywords. Finally, we analyzed the sentiment of the sentences - the classifier previously trained for the NYT (nearest centroid) assigned a (positive or negative) value to the sentences extracted from the articles.\n",
